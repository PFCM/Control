# MIDI messages are:
# 		    note on          — drumstick solenoid on
#		    note off         — drumstick solenoid off
# 		    pitch bend       — set point of pivot servo
#		    control change 7 — angle of drumstick stop servo
#
# We can leave the default note and control, but we are going to need  messages for CC 
# and pitch bend
128="/noteoff,ii"=128,$1,$2 # note off passes straight through
224="/position,ii"=224,$1,$2 # pitch bend also passes straight through
# Good idea to add some notes so users get a chance to see what does what
