	abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: This article introduces the Machine Orchestra, a mixed ensemble of human and robotic performers. The Orchestra is coordinated through technical and musical classes at the California Institute of the Arts ({CalArts)}, where the pedagogical focus is to combine the musical elements of a laptop orchestra with the technical skills required to create a robotic ensemble. As of this publication, seven electromechanical instruments have been developed by members and collaborators of the Orchestra. The ensemble has given notable international premieres and performances at venues including the Roy and Edna {Disney/CalArts} Theater ({REDCAT)} in Los Angeles and {01SJ}, the biennial music and arts festival in San Jose, California. Well-known researchers and performers are invited to participate in the Orchestra to bring novel technical, musical, and collaborative ideas to the ensemble. In this article we describe the design and production of seven robotic instruments, details on the visual and sonic aesthetic of the ensemble, technical considerations of the computer network employed in performance, and information on an assortment of compositions in the current repertoire. History, Influences, and Curriculum This section traces the history of the Laptop Orchestra as a teaching laboratory and performance ensemble, and the integration of these concepts into the robotic-design curriculum in the {CalArts} Music Technology Program. Evolution of the Laptop Orchestra In 2006, Dan Trueman and Perry Cook unleashed the Princeton Laptop Orchestra ({PLOrk;} Trueman et al. 2006), revealing a new paradigm for teaching, composing, and performing live interactive computer music. Previous ensembles performing live with multiple networked laptops, such as The Hub, generally had fewer than five performers on stage, significantly fewer than the 16 to 25 members of {PLOrk.} The latter ensemble championed the idea of a laptop orchestra as a learning laboratory of musical interaction design, networked performance, and musical composition, revolutionizing the auditory display and human-computer interfaces used in large electroacoustic ensembles. In {PLOrk}, each performer's instrument includes a standardized suite of hardware and software: an Apple laptop, a hemispherical speaker, and several devices for gestural input (Wang et al. 2008). Click for larger view Figure 1. Machine Orchestra with human-robot relationship. [Editor's note: the humanoid icons in this article represent humans, not robots.] And thus began the {"Age} of the {LOrk."} In 2008, Ge Wang, a pivotal member of the original {PLOrk}, joined the Stanford Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics and founded the first {LOrk} on the west coast, The Stanford Laptop Orchestra ({SLOrk).} Inspired by the original Princeton model, other laptop orchestras have been forming around the world. Direct collaboration with {SLOrk} and {PLOrk} led to the creation of the Oslo and Boulder laptop orchestras. Other groups unaffiliated with educational institutions have also started to emerge, including the Moscow Cyberlaptop Orchestra, the Tokyo Laptop Orchestra, and the Seattle Laptop Orchestra. In 2009, The Virginia Institute of Technology founded the first {LOrk} created fully through open source technology, aptly named the Linux Laptop Orchestra, {L2Ork.} The concept of a {LOrk} has also transitioned to mobile devices, with the first mobile phone orchestra ({MoPho)} performing in 2008 (Wang, Essl, and Penttinen 2008). Since then, other networked ensembles of phones have surfaced, including the Michigan Mobile Phone Orchestra, The Helsinki {MoPho}, and the Berlin Mobile Phone Orchestra. (See the Appendix for a full listing of the ensembles and their respective Web sites.) Following in the footsteps of other {LOrks}, and influenced by robotic orchestras such as Eric Singer and Paul Lehrman's Ballet Mécanique Automated Orchestra and Pat Metheny's Orchestrion, the Machine Orchestra has endeavored to create a laptop orchestra with a robotic dimension (see Figure 1). Adding to the pedagogical disciplines and experience of established laptop ensembles, the Machine Orchestra focuses on teaching students a bottom-up approach to musical robotics, going through mechanical engineering for actuators, acoustic engineering for instrument design, and electrical engineering and computer science for human-machine interaction design. The Orchestra and related classes form the core of the upper-level Music Technology curriculum, combining the resources from {CalArts'} School of Music and School of Theater. {CalArts} Robotic Design Curriculum The robotic instruments built by the Machine Orchestra began out of a collaboration between {CalArts'} School of Music and...},

Signal is a framework for musical synchronisation and data sharing, designed to support the use of musical robotics in an attempt to more fully address ideas of interconnectivity and embodied performance. Signal, in combination with musical robotics, also facilitates the exploration of interaction contexts, such as at the note level, score level and sound-processing level. In this way, {TMO} is simultaneously building upon the historical contributions and developing aesthetics of network music.},

@thesis{wang_chuck_2008,

	title = {The Chuck Audio Programming Language. "a Strongly-timed and On-the-fly {Environ/Mentality"}},
	abstract = {The computer has long been considered an extremely attractive tool for creating, manipulating, and analyzing sound. Its precision, possibilities for new timbres, and potential for fantastical automation make it a compelling platform for expression and experimentation—but only to the extent that we are able to express to the computer what to do, and how to do it. To this end, the programming language has perhaps served as the most general, and yet most precise and intimate interface between humans and computers. Furthermore, "domain-specific" languages can bring additional expressiveness, conciseness, and perhaps even dfferent ways of thinking to their users. This thesis argues for the philosophy, design, and development of {ChucK}, a general-purpose programming language tailored for computer music. The goal is to create a language that is expressive and easy to write and read with respect to time and parallelism, and to provide a platform for precise audio synthesis/analysis and rapid experimentation in computer music. In particular, {ChucK} provides a syntax for representing information flow, a new time-based concurrent programming model that allows programmers to flexibly and precisely control the flow of time in code (we call this "strongly-timed"), and facilities to develop programs on-the-fly —as they run. A {ChucKian} approach to live coding as a new musical performance paradigm is also described. In turn, this motivates the Audicle, a specialized graphical environment designed to facilitate on-the-fly programming, to visualize and monitor {ChucK} programs in real-time, and to provide a platform for building highly customizable user interfaces. In addition to presenting the {ChucK} programming language, a history of music and programming is provided (Chapter 2), and the various aspects of the {ChucK} language are evaluated in the context of computer music research, performance, and pedagogy (Chapter 6). As part of an extensive case study, the thesis discusses {ChucK} as a primary teaching and development tool in the Princeton Laptop Orchestra ({PLOrk)}, which continues to be a powerful platform for deploying {ChucK} (1) to teach topics ranging from programming to sound synthesis to music composition, and (2) for crafting new instruments, compositions, and performances for computer-mediated ensembles. Additional applications are also described, including classrooms, live coding arenas, compositions and performances, user studies, and integrations of {ChucK} into other software systems. The contributions of this work include the following. (1) A time-based programming mechanism (both language and underlying implementation) for ultra-precise audio synthesis, naturally extensible to real-time audio analysis. (2) A non-preemptive, time/event-based concurrent programming model that provides fundamental flexibility and readability without incurring many of the difficulties of programming concurrency. (3) A {ChucKian} approach to writing code and designing audio programs on-the-fly. This rapid prototyping mentality has potentially wide ramifications in the way we think about coding audio, in designing/testing software (particular for real-time audio), as well as new paradigms and practices in computer-mediated live performance.(4) The Audicle as a new type of audio programming environment that combines live development with visualizations. (5) Extended case studies of using, teaching, composing, and performing with {ChucK}, most prominently in the Laptop Orchestra. These show the power of teaching programming via music, and vice versa—and how these two disciplines can reinforce each other.},
