	- Add input to client into data files
	  - do associate parsing work in MidiInstrument
	  - send properly
	- TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST

6/12/13
	- MAKE IT WORK
	- MIDI in to client working, but OSC not sending
	- Server receiving OSC working and sending MIDI
	- note IAC driver does not appear to support loopback to the same app
	- need figure out why Server is not getting Client's OSC
	- probably come up with a better test rig (VM? Bring in a MIDI device? Two computers?

9/12/13
	- Sort out MIDI message composition from arguments
	  - might be quite nice to be able to compose them from arbitrary length OSC messages

12/12/13
	- Set up git so that mac mini is the master repo
	- write docs

16/12/13
	- tone down some of the printing
	- get set up for actual robots?
	- Fix so that instruments that fail initialisation don't report success
	  - will probably require a field in Instrument so the server can check
	    whether or not it worked, or have init() (and __init()) return a
	    value.
	- Multiple MIDI messages from one OSC 
	- notes --TEST
