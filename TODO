	- Add input to client into data files
	  - do associate parsing work in MidiInstrument
	  - send properly
	- TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST

6/12/13
	- MAKE IT WORK
	- MIDI in to client working, but OSC not sending
	- Server receiving OSC working and sending MIDI
	- note IAC driver does not appear to support loopback to the same app
	- need figure out why Server is not getting Client's OSC
	- probably come up with a better test rig (VM? Bring in a MIDI device? Two computers?

9/12/13
	- Sort out MIDI message composition from arguments
	  - might be quite nice to be able to compose them from arbitrary length OSC messages

12/12/13
	- Set up git so that mac mini is the master repo
	- write docs

16/12/13
	- tone down some of the printing
	- get set up for actual robots?
	- Fix so that instruments that fail initialisation don't report success
	  - will probably require a field in Instrument so the server can check
	    whether or not it worked, or have init() (and __init()) return a
	    value.
	- Multiple MIDI messages from one OSC 
	- notes --TEST

20/12/13
	- string chooser 
	  - finish
	  - test in software
	- keep trying to break the network stuff
	


10/1/14
	- test string chooser

16/1/14
	- auto device detection (map of known midi ports to devices?)
	  - definitely fix up devices opening on unknown midi ports
	    - potential issue with numerically specified
	- abstract multi channel instruments to 1 ch
	  - mechbass done, how to Swivel??
	- Keep channels on client as constant as possible
	- delay compensation
	  - check as many instruments as possible
	  - test time between server sending note and audio coming in
	  - build a delay into Instrument
	  - set delays of all instruments to maximum-own
	- string picking (as in choosing? What does this mean?)
	- harmonium failsafe (done) general writing about motor control
	- system check / screensaver mode (test, make better)
	- parametric encodings (talk to Jim)
